According to him, the only way to get anything done around our place of work is to work through your lunch hour. I did the math on how much time you are giving for free and I found that it added up to 32.5 work days, assuming you work 8 hour days that is, which is just over a month of free labor you are providing to your place of business. So my recommendation is to not do that, and if you do, at least understand the cumulative total of what you are doing for free to people who should be paying you.</p>\n\n<p>Edit thanks for all the awards guys, makes me smile.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m seeing continued posts about my map being wrong, and I thought I&#39;d clears up some initial confusion. 24 hours is not a work day, you need to divide 260 hours by 8 hours because 8 hours is a standard workday.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/LifeProTips/comments/kfottr/lpt_do_not_work_through_your_lunch_hour_an_hour_a/","title":"LPT: Do not work through your lunch hour.
