So 1 day off every 3 months. None of us in the office get ANY benefits. No PTO, no medical, no holidays, nothing. We were also told that because we (the hygienists) are booked out so far that when we take our day off we will have to come in early or work late to make up for the patients we didn’t see that day.</p>\n\n<p>Me and the other hygienists all put in our letters of resignation today. We all typed letters and laid them on his desk. So he got back from lunch and had to read through all the letters. My coworker told me that she saw him throw our stack of letters at the office manager while saying “look at this.”</p>\n\n<p>Fortunately hygienists are in crazy high demand in CA right now and all of us already have other job offers.</p>\n\n<p>Tl;dr - boss tries to control our unpaid time off and vastly overestimates his worth. Winds up losing his whole clinical staff.</p>\n\n<p>Update since this blew up: for everyone that’s calling BS, I posted my resignation letter and screen shots of texts in the comments. I had one prepared already but I made another one at lunch and printed it out because I felt like I needed to specify that I was quitting because of the policy on unpaid overtime. And yes I did print it out at work lol. </p>\n\n<p>Update 2: my boss decided to act like nothing happened. He didn’t mention anything or even say a word about it to me and the other staff members that were quitting. My coworker did see him toss the resignation letters at our office manager and say “look at this…”\nThe doctor and my office manager were also in a meeting by themselves at 5pm. He always leaves at around 330 so it was satisfying to see him staying late to sort this out. They both gave me a death stare when I walked by the little window to the room they were in though.</p>\n\n<p>Update 3: for those asking, yes I have another job already. I decided to quit Sunday night and by Monday afternoon I had another job that’s 30 mins closer, higher pay and I get off 2.5 hours earlier</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/antiwork/comments/qvlts5/half_of_my_offices_staff_is_quitting_today/","title":"Half of my offices’ staff is quitting today","tags":["antiwork","reddit"],"date":"November 17, 2021","dateISO":"2021-11-17T18:18:00.000Z","datetime":"2021-11-17 18:18","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"qvlts5","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/qvlts5/half_of_my_offices_staff_is_quitting_today/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/qvlts5/half_of_my_offices_staff_is_quitting_today/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"antiwork","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork","author":"Legacy0904","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/Legacy0904","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"Legacy0904","score":75092,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"私のオフィスのスタッフの半分は今日で辞めます。","the_new_excerpt":"先週の木曜日、私の職場（カリフォルニア州の非常に裕福な地域にある歯科医院）のミーティングがありました。\n私の職場（カリフォルニア州の裕福な地域にある歯科医院）では、ミーティングで、四半期に1日しか休みが認められないことを知らされました。\n四半期 つまり、3ヶ月に1日の休みということになります。私たちは誰も福利厚生を受けていません。\nPTOも医療費も、休日も何もありません。また、私たちはこうも言われました...。","locale":"ja"},{"title":"我的办公室有一半的员工今天要辞职了","the_new_excerpt":"上周四，我的办公室（位于加州一个非常富裕的地区的牙科诊所）举行了一次会议。\n会议上，我们被告知，我们每季度只能被批准休息一天。\n季度休息一天。因此，每3个月有1天假期。我们办公室的人都没有任何福利。\n没有PTO，没有医疗，没有假期，什么都没有。我们还被告知...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"我的辦公室有一半的員工今天要辭職了","the_new_excerpt":"上週四，我的辦公室（位於加州一個非常富裕的地區的牙科診所）舉行了一次會議。\n會議上，我們被告知，我們每季度只能被批准休息一天。\n季度休息一天。因此，每3個月有1天假期。我們辦公室的人都沒有任何福利。\n沒有PTO，沒有醫療，沒有假期，什麼都沒有。我們還被告知...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-qvqvt1","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/pics/comments/qvqvt1/paul_rudd_and_wilford_brimley_each_at_age_52/","title":"Paul Rudd and Wilford Brimley, each at age 52","date":"November 17, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"ポール・ラッドとウィルフォード・ブリムリー、それぞれ52歳のとき","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"ja"},{"title":"保罗-鲁德和威尔福德-布林利，各为52岁","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"保羅-魯德和威爾福德-布林利，各爲52歲","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-qvynut","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/MurderedByWords/comments/qvynut/a_16_year_old_takes_her_shot_and_politely/","title":"A 16 year old takes her shot and politely dispatches her belittling elders","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"November 17, 2021","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"16歳の少女がショットを撮り、小言を言う年長者を丁寧に追い払った。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"ja"},{"title":"一个16岁的孩子出手了，并有礼貌地打发了轻视她的长辈们。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"一個16歲的孩子出手了，並有禮貌地打發了輕視她的長輩們。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"basePath":"/","pageType":"detail","id":"RedditPost-qvlts5","previousId":"RedditPost-qvqvt1","nextId":"RedditPost-qvynut","maxWidth":1024,"siteMetadata":null,"locale":"ja","hrefLang":"ja-JA","originalPath":"/reddit/r/antiwork/comments/qvlts5/half_of_my_offices_staff_is_quitting_today/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},
