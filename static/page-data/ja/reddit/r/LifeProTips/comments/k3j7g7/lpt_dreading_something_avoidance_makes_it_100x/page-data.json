Once you decide on your goal, emotions are the hints your brain uses to help you decide whether a certain situation HELPS or HINDERS your progression towards that goal. In turn, this influences your behaviour. Thoughts - Feelings - Behaviour. Nothing is inherently good or bad, it is all relative to what you are trying to achieve. Read that sentence again.</p>\n\n<p>If your goal is avoidance, then any progression or confrontation is going to feel very uncomfortable because your brain will be going &quot;nope, this is bad. This is not what you wanted. Sending bad feedback.&quot; You can just as easily shift your goal (this is what mindset is, and it IS up to you) and in turn, change your brain&#39;s response to the stimulus around you (emotions). Even if it is an uncomfortable situation, your brain will recognise that it&#39;s helping you achieve your goal, so the feedback it gives you (emotions) will be much more positive. It all starts with what you want to achieve and if you don&#39;t know, then spend some time figuring that out. Goal clarity is like giving your brain a quest marker.</p>\n\n<p>You are hardwired for struggle, go forth in courage my comrades!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/LifeProTips/comments/k3j7g7/lpt_dreading_something_avoidance_makes_it_100x/","title":"LPT: Dreading something?
