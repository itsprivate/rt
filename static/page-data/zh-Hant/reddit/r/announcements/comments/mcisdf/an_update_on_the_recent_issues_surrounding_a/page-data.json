We built a relationship with her first as a mod and then through her contractor work on RPAN. We did not adequately vet her background before formally hiring her. </p>\n\n<p>We’ve put significant effort into improving how we handle doxxing and harassment, and this employee was the subject of both. In this case, we over-indexed on protection, which had serious consequences in terms of enforcement actions. </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>On March 9th, we added extra protections for this employee, including actioning content that mentioned the employee’s name or shared personal information on third-party sites, which we reserve for serious cases of harassment and doxxing.</li>\n<li>On March 22nd, a news article about this employee was posted by a mod of <a href=\"/r/ukpolitics\">r/ukpolitics</a>. The article was removed and the submitter banned by the aforementioned rules. When contacted by the moderators of <a href=\"/r/ukpolitics\">r/ukpolitics</a>, we reviewed the actions, and reversed the ban on the moderator, and we informed the <a href=\"/r/ukpolitics\">r/ukpolitics</a> moderation team that we had restored the mod.</li>\n<li>We updated our rules to flag potential harassment for human review.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Debate and criticism have always been and always will be central to conversation on Reddit—including discussion about public figures and Reddit itself—as long as they are not used as vehicles for harassment. Mentioning a public figure’s name should not get you banned.</p>\n\n<p>We care deeply for Reddit and appreciate that you do too. We understand the anger and confusion about these issues and their bigger implications. The employee is no longer with Reddit, and we’ll be evolving a number of relevant internal policies.</p>\n\n<p>We did not operate to our own standards here. We will do our best to do better for you.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/announcements/comments/mcisdf/an_update_on_the_recent_issues_surrounding_a/","title":"An update on the recent issues surrounding a Reddit employee","tags":["announcements","reddit"],"date":"March 25, 2021","dateISO":"2021-03-25T10:48:22.000Z","datetime":"2021-03-25 10:48","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"37250ff8-301a-59ab-afd3-4b75af2c2d3e","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/mcisdf/an_update_on_the_recent_issues_surrounding_a/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/mcisdf/an_update_on_the_recent_issues_surrounding_a/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"announcements","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements","author":"spez","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/spez","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"spez","score":102112,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"关于最近围绕Reddit员工的问题的最新情况。","the_new_excerpt":"我们想向大家介绍一下最近发生的问题的最新情况。\n发生在Reddit某位员工身上的事情，并为您提供\n的背景下，我们采取了行动，以防止doxxing和骚扰。\n\n截至目前，该名员工已不再受雇于Reddit。我们建立了\na…","locale":"zh"},{"title":"關於最近圍繞Reddit員工的問題的最新情況。","the_new_excerpt":"我們想向大家介紹一下最近發生的問題的最新情況。\n發生在Reddit某位員工身上的事情，併爲您提供\n的背景下，我們採取了行動，以防止doxxing和騷擾。\n\n截至目前，該名員工已不再受僱於Reddit。我們建立了\na…","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-478474fb-564f-5615-8119-0d6004ddec1c","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/interestingasfuck/comments/mcmtv4/in_2017_a_man_digging_to_install_power_cables/","title":"In 2017, a man digging to install power cables under his lawn in Arkansas instead stumbled across a gargantuan, 3,000+ pound Quartz cluster! it later sold for $500,000!","date":"March 25, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"2017年，一名男子在阿肯色州的草坪下挖土安装电力电缆，却偶然发现了一个巨大的、3000多磅重的石英簇！后来它以50万美元的价格成交。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"2017年，一名男子在阿肯色州的草坪下挖土安裝電力電纜，卻偶然發現了一個巨大的、3000多磅重的石英簇！後來它以50萬美元的價格成交。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-1f513d00-be18-58fb-9ee9-956622e78e30","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/funny/comments/mce3j0/why_do_you_want_to_work_for_our_company/","title":"Why do you want to work for our company ?","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"March 25, 2021","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"你为什么想在我们公司工作？","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"你爲什麼想在我們公司工作？","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"basePath":"/","pageType":"detail","id":"RedditPost-37250ff8-301a-59ab-afd3-4b75af2c2d3e","previousId":"RedditPost-478474fb-564f-5615-8119-0d6004ddec1c","nextId":"RedditPost-1f513d00-be18-58fb-9ee9-956622e78e30","maxWidth":1024,"siteMetadata":null,"locale":"zh-Hant","hrefLang":"zh-Hant","originalPath":"/reddit/r/announcements/comments/mcisdf/an_update_on_the_recent_issues_surrounding_a/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2744905544","3280999885"]}
