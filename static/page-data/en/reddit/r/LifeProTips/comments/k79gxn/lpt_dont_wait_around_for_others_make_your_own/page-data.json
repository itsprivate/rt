I am fairly young (26) so don’t really have any hard feelings about it. I always felt I needed others to enjoy the same hobbies as me to actually enjoy doing them. This made me miss a lot of opportunities to just enjoy life. </p>\n\n<p>If you want to do something (anything, be it physical, mental) just do it. By all means, extend an invite to others, but if nobody makes plans, just go do it yourself. </p>\n\n<p>Instead of asking “hey, we should go out and do ______ some time”, say “hey, I’m going to go _________, did you want to come?”</p>\n\n<p>This way you already have plans to do whatever it is you’re doing, and you’re just extending an invite. Not actually basing whether you will do thing on someone else. </p>\n\n<p>Hope this helps someone!</p>\n\n<p>Edit: A lot of comments are pointing this out. Obviously with Covid you need to be responsible about these “activities”. In my case, fishing alone outdoors really doesn’t have any covid complications.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/LifeProTips/comments/k79gxn/lpt_dont_wait_around_for_others_make_your_own/","title":"LPT: Don’t wait around for others.
